# Merge Conflict

## Introduction

![alt text](Karl.png) 

Meet Karl "Kalle" Carl√©n. 
The latest new recruit at knowit solutions cocreate.

Together, you will begin your journey. 
A magnificent journey of ~~discovery, learning, companionship, adventure and triumph~~
disillusionment, apathy, desperation, exhaustion and general #CorporateLife misery; 
it's what we're all about here at cocreate.

It's grey in the office (reduce saturation in the whole game) and people are overworked by the mean boss Sara.
Occasionally, you find someone crying in the bathroom.
But there are hints that something is wrong, long ago these cocreators used to be happy.

So buckle up junior, it's time to climb that corporate ladder. How far will your career take you...


## Storyline

The main aim is to take your junior developer into the consultancy world, completing assignments to chase the permanent contract. 
These assignments and the game will give a insight into cocreate, our people, our culture/workplace/platinan life, the tools we like to use, and our ways of working, with a satirical twist.


### Assignment Ideas

1. Cofinder (first assignment)
	- Player will get a brief overview of what cofinder is
	- Need to construct snippets of code into a working api request to get job postings
	- Solve a puzzle to generate a satisfactory ai prompt matching consultants to job
	Finishes with getting a slack notification about a suitable role at *the company that shall not be named*.

1. *the company that shall not be named* (a.k.a "Taking one for the team")
	- Aim is to create a data pipeline
	- Start with standing in rain outside knowit, waiting for a bus to the customer, many full buses first
	- Once on site, player will search for pieces of pipe (various staging, intermediate and core pieces) and purchase tools from their PO (dagster-wrench, dbt-hammer and snowflake-saw) and construct them in a way to churn data into valuable insight
	- Avoid middle management who provide minor distraction tasks that must be complete before player can add pipe pieces (though some needed as these generate credits to buy the tools from your PO)
	- Office area full of people wandering around in darkness, some are the middle managers, and player is followed by spotlight/carrying a torch (because there is no natural light)
	- Once pipeline built, player will have to frantically mash excel sheets into the pipeline
	- The pipeline will eventually yield a single uninformative crappy pie chart which is shown to an executive, *Lord Volvoldemort* (a levitating shirtless & bearded yogi) who looks at it and gives his approval ("woaaaah... far out man" and then floats away)

1. Final assignment
	- Return to knowit office and take on another assignment
	- Sara isn't impressed
	- Things are worse at the office; she's burnt the pingis table to the ground, has taken away fika, and is charging for coffee
	- \<INSERT AN ACTUAL ASSIGNMENT - KNOWYOURDATA? Brings the player close to Alexander - he needs power bi help; see below \>
	- Finishes with battling Sara Boss
	- The twist, it's a cyborg version of Sara - Sarnie Schwarzeknowiter, sent from the future by AXS CloudNet, the evil meta-cloud service provider collecting everyones personal data - that has kidnapped her
	- Sarnie was in charge all along and wanted to make everyone miserable
	- AXS CloudNet was just Alexander running an on-prem storage on a Raspberry Pi in an "out of order" bathroom, where he was also holding Sara
	- The player saves Sara and suddenly color levels rise in office and she rights all the wrongs, reminding us of what makes cocreate great
	- Everyone is happy, you saved the day and get rewarded with a permanent contract - you're a CoCreator now!
	- "Go forth and CoCreate... I said CoCreate - not procreate - I can't lose more of you to parental leave and vab!"


### Sidequest/Minigame Ideas

- Pingis
	- Atari Pong style minigame
	- 3 opponents; Stefan is Boss Level
- Office Help
	- Linda is on VAB, can you help keep on top of filling coffee, doing dishes, tidying, moving furniture, setting up breakfast/fika (telling player that breakfast before monday meeting) etc.
	- Whatever happens, the player fails; ends with arriving next day and Linda has just about finished tidying up your mess
- Puzzle Table
	- Can you solve Toms 46 million pice puzzle
	- Can you find the missing puzzle piece; way to learn the office layout? Get hints of location sending layer to specific meeting rooms, bike storage, poppels etc.
- Fika Red Light/Green Light:
	- It's 2pm friday so it's fika, but you arrive late and there is one last piece; can you beat other consultants in a game of red light-green light to take the last piece when the boss isn't looking
- Decaf Anton
	- As part of an assignment, Anton speaks to the player, but it's too fast to read
	- The player has to sneak decaf into the coffee machine (gets hint from Sara?)
	- It will slow the entire game down for a short period once Anton drinks *n* cups (player brings him a cup?) but now Anton can be understood
